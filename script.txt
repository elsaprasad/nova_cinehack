The Last Signal

(Short Film – 10 Scenes)

INT. APARTMENT – NIGHT
A dimly lit room. Computer parts and empty coffee mugs clutter the desk.
JASON (28), sharp but exhausted, stares at his laptop.

On screen: “SYSTEM BREACH DETECTED – PRIORITY CODE”

Jason mutters under his breath.
JASON
(determined)
Not again. Not tonight.

He stuffs hard drives, cables, and a small antenna into his backpack.

EXT. CITY STREET – NIGHT
Jason sprints down an empty street. Streetlights flicker as if reacting to something unseen.
Distant sirens wail. A car alarm goes off, then suddenly dies mid-blare.

Jason glances back—he’s being watched, but no one’s there.

INT. SUBWAY STATION – NIGHT
Jason boards the last train.
The car is empty, humming with fluorescent light.

He checks his phone: NO SIGNAL.
Jason grips the phone tighter, his reflection in the window looks more anxious than he does.

EXT. HILLTOP – DAWN
Jason climbs up the hill, out of breath.
The city sprawls below, bathed in pale orange light.

He unpacks a compact antenna, assembles it quickly, and points it skyward.

JASON
(whispering to himself)
Come on… just connect…

The device emits a faint beep. Relief flashes across his face.

INT. CAR – DAY
Jason hitches a ride with LUCY (25), tough and skeptical.
She drives in silence, side-eyeing Jason’s battered backpack.

LUCY
So, what’s in the bag?
JASON
(quietly)
Something people are willing to kill for.
LUCY
(half-smile)
Sounds fun.

EXT. GARDEN – DAY
They arrive at an abandoned garden, overrun with weeds.
Jason kneels, digging in the dirt until his fingers hit something hard.

He pulls out a rusted, waterproof case. Opens it—inside is a hard drive wrapped in foil.

Lucy raises an eyebrow.
LUCY
That’s it? You risked your life for an antique?
JASON
It’s not just data. It’s the last signal.

INT. SAFEHOUSE – EVENING
A small, dust-filled room with a flickering bulb.
Jason connects the hard drive to a forgotten desktop.

The screen fills with encrypted maps and long sequences of numbers.

LUCY
What the hell am I looking at?
JASON
Coordinates. Access points. Everything they tried to erase.

Lucy’s face tightens—she doesn’t know whether to believe him.

EXT. SEA CLIFF – SUNSET
The ocean roars beneath them.
Jason wires the hard drive to a portable transmitter.

The device emits a deep hum, growing louder with each second.

LUCY
(uneasy)
What happens when you turn it on?
JASON
(quietly)
The truth goes everywhere. No one can stop it.

INT. CONTROL ROOM – NIGHT
In an undisclosed facility, alarms BLARE.
Operators scramble. Screens light up with Jason’s transmission.

A COMMANDER slams his fist on the console.
COMMANDER
The signal’s been activated. Shut it down! NOW!

Technicians frantically type—but the system is already unraveling.

EXT. ROOFTOP – NIGHT
Jason and Lucy stand on a high rooftop overlooking the city.

One by one, city lights flicker… then go dark.
The skyline disappears into shadow.

Lucy stares, half terrified, half in awe.
LUCY
What did you just do?
JASON
(whispers)
I gave them the truth.

The wind howls. The screen cuts to black.
